    <h2>Useless Blog #4</h2>

<div id="postcontent">
    
     <p> This was supposed to be my grand comeback to my <del>millions</del> <del>thousands</del> <del>hundreds</del>  <del>dozens</del> maybe one reader where I would teach them the ways of <a href='http://elm-lang.org/'>Elm</a> and functional  programming in the browser from atop my glorious Mountain of Enlightenment in a blog post  that would teach them how to make the <a href='/extras/googly-eye.html'>Eye of Doom!!!!!!</a> (which is just this SVG  drawing that looks more like a sunny side up egg than an eye, that follows your mouse  around). But I couldn't write that post in good faith if I couldn't explain stuff in a  way that would make sense to someone new. I think I understand Elm's concepts but for  some stuff I couldn't put it into the right words that would explain my understanding  properly, which just means I don't have a firm understanding of it yet. So I shelved  that blog post and you get this one instead (yaaay!!??).   </p><p> Maybe one day I'll understand it well enough to find the right words for that blog  post. Until then, here's the <a href='https://github.com/dragsubil/googly-eye'>source code</a> if you want to look.  </p>

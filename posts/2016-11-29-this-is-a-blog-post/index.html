    <p>This is a blog post. The first in (hopefully) a series. A series of blog posts where I write about whatever is on my mind, probably mostly about computer stuff that I'm doing. An activity log, if you will. Maybe writing this is a way to organize my thoughts. Does it work? I don't know! I only just started. I also find that announcing out loud that I'm going to do  something severely decreases the chance of it ever getting done. Which is why I'm not going to say that I intend to write a blog post every other day. </p><p><em>But you just did!</em></p><p>I typed it. There's a difference.</p><p><em>No there isn't. Announcing out loud and posting on a public website are just two different forms of the same action!</em></p><p>Shut up Italics guy.</p><p>Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, organizing my thoughts. This might be a good way to debrief what I've  learned. Also a good way to practice writing things out. This is an exercise for me (Lord knows I don't get enough of that).</p><p>Now that that's out of the way, lets address the elephant in the room. How the <em>hell</em> did you get here? You, yes you, the reader. Let me assure you that there other way more interesting programmer blogs out there. </p><ul><li><a href='http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/'>Steve Yegge</a> (and his <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants'>old one</a> too)</li><li><a href='http://jvns.ca/'>Julia Evans</a></li><li><a href='https://blog.codinghorror.com/'>Coding Horror</a></li></ul><p>Or just go visit reddit. Here's a <a href='https://www.reddit.com/user/ashish2199/m/cs_student_subs/'>multireddit</a> to get you started.</p><p>That's it for this time. Tune in next time for Subil's exciting adventures in Linux, or Lisp, or Python. Who knows.</p>

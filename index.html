    <p><strong><i>I'M BACK BOIIII!!</i></strong></p><p>Man it's good to have internet again! That storm did a number on my city but we're getting back up now. In order to keep my brain from oozing out  from sheer boredom during the day,  I've been doing nothing but reading this past week. Thought I'd share my opinions on a couple of books in this comeback post. Here we go!</p>

    <p>You know, I was supposed to be learning <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> in the hopes adding  something employable my resume (all I have right now is 'knows some python'). But I end up messing around on reddit instead. <em>Sigh</em>.</p><p>Anyway, if you've used reddit for any length of time, you've probably noticed a few bot accounts. They're usually there to perform some tasks on behalf of the humans. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/">Automoderator</a> is ubiquitous throughout reddit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/remindmebot">RemindMeBot</a> can be called on demand to set a reminder for yourself by calling for it in  the comments or via PM. Those are just a couple of the many throughout  reddit.</p>

    <p>I realize that the posting schedule has gone to whack but that last post was  too long to finish in one day. And so I decided I could skip a day as a reward (not that I dislike writing these, mind! But I didn't want to overextend myself). Also I realize this is not necessarily a technical post but it is something I need  to address, for my own sake. </p><p>I was of the opinion that if you were aware of or had read about a situation before,  you could identify it immediately when it occurred to you and you could be prepared to handle it.  (This doesn't apply for every situation, of course. No amount of reading could suitably prepare you for, say, being dropped in front a herd of hungry velociraptors). Turns out I wasn't entirely right.</p>

    <p>I <em>love</em> Neal Stephenson's books. He is the God Uncle of cyberpunk (the God<em>father</em> of cyberpunk is, of course, William Gibson). One of Stephenson's doorstoppers is Cryptonomicon, a MASSIVE, 1100+ page monstrosity jam packed with everything you could want in a historical fiction/sorta cyberpunk novel. It's got action, World War II code breaking, guest appearances by Alan Turing, digressions on cryptography, a few predictions about the future (internet banking being one of them. Remember, it was published in 1999) and a ton of other things I can't remember. It even had graphs. <em>GRAPHS</em> for duck's sake.</p><p>Anyway, one of the things I remembered reading about in the book is Ordoemacs. Ordoemacs is <em>the</em> text editor for the paranoid. Everything written in Ordoemacs is automatically encrypted when written to disk. At least, that's how I remembered it. So I wanted to do something similar, but in Vim. Thus, Ordovim.</p>

    <p><em>Oh hey. You're back. I didn't think you'd write another post.</em></p><p>Yeah, well, I said I would, didn't I? So here I am. But it's not like I have  anything interesting to say though. I thought I would learn enough in two days to write something interesting. But the most interesting thing I did that I have any coherent thoughts about is that I shaved my head.  <br /></p>
